Terraform is an IAC tool, used primarily by DevOps teams to automate various infrastructure tasks. The provisioning of cloud resources, for instance, is one of the main use cases of Terraform. Itâ€™s a cloud-agnostic, open-source provisioning tool written in the Go language and created by HashiCorp.

Terraform allows you to describe your complete infrastructure in the form of code. Even if your servers come from different providers such as AWS or Azure, Terraform helps you build and manage these resources in parallel across providers. Think of Terraform as connective tissue and common language that you can utilize to manage your entire IT stack.
